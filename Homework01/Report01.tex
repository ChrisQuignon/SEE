\section{Experimental setup}
\subsection{Robot Design}
%especially how you mark the stop position and how you ensure identical start positions.
We choose to use the "\href{http://www.damienkee.com/home/2011/8/20/domabot-classroom-robot-design.html}{Domabot}" design (see Figure~\ref{fig:front_view}) in order to minimize the measurement errors. This design has several advantages in this regard:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Motors are directly attached to the brick. Thus the points where distortion can happen are minimized.
\item The center of gravity is very low which increases stability.
\item The track width is big which also increases stability.
\item The free running wheel (see Figure~\ref{fig:free_wheel}) is rigid and quite narrow. Thus it adds less error by friction or deformation.
\end{itemize}

To mark the endpoints of our measures, we designed a pen holder  (See Figure~\ref{fig:pen}) that could adapt to pen size, and be flipped up and down (See Figure~\ref{fig:pen_position}) to not hinder the movement.

\section{The program}

The program at its core uses the \texttt{
\href{http://www.lejos.org/nxt/nxj/api/lejos/robotics/navigation/DifferentialPilot.html}{lejos.robotics.navigation.DifferentialPilot}} and two of its functions: \texttt{travel(distance)} and \texttt{travelArc(-radius, distance)}. For convenience we added some structure that allows us to select the direction to drive with the buttons on the robot without the need to restart the program.

\subsection{Program Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item wheelDiameter = 5.6f\\
A wheel diameter is specified as 5.8cm in the Handbook and on the wheel itself.

\item trackWidth = 17.6f\
The track width of the robot, measured in cm.

\item distance = 90.0\\
The distance the robot aims to dive in cm.

\item radius\\
 = $250 * \pi \ 180 * 90 = 392.699$\\
 We decided to go with an angular description of the arc in degree for better understanding and a more meaningful tuning. The function needs a radius in cm as input, but we kept the calculation in the code and thus documented best.\\
 Please not that 250 is actually not an angle value in degree!\\
 The angle is $90/392.699 = 0.229 radians$ or $13.13^{\circ} degree$.
 
\item Delay.msDelay(500)\\
The direction of turn is selected by pushing a button. Before starting the movement, we wait for half a second, so the operator can remove the finger and the robot can recover from the push.
\end{itemize}

\section{Execution}
After writing and tuning the program we set up the execution in several steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Load the robots battery to a maximum.
\item Tape together the two sheets of paper on the back side to they perfectly meet without gap or overlap.
\item Tape down the sheets to the ground so they can not move.
\item Put the robot in its starting position.
\item Draw a starting box around the robots shadow (fixed light source) to mark the starting position.
\item Calibrate the pen to touch the paper vertically (See Figure~\ref{fig:pen_calib})
\item Start the program
\item Perform each run:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Raise the pen
	\item Set the robot to starting position by aligning its shadow (See Figure~\ref{fig:setup})
	\item Align free running wheel along the robots main axis
	\item Select the driving direction with the buttons
	\item Wait for the robot to execute
	\item Lower the pen to mark its arrival position
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Observations}
\subsection{Execution}

We run 20 points on each direction. First ahead, then left then right. The points showed up without any pattern and no particular order. But there was, as expected a visible difference in the spread for every direction.\\
In the last third of the 16\textsuperscript{th} run while going to the left, the right wheel came off the axis of the robot (See Figure~\ref{fig:failure}).
We marked the landing position, as it was far off the point cloud up to that point to render it as a failure during the analysis. We fixed the wheel back on the axis and continued the experiment. All following points were also marked but showed no extraordinary spread. To end up with 20 measurement without the failure, we added one more.

 \label{fig:failure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurement}
The used measuring facilities are a retractable and a 50 cm ruler, both with sensitivity of 1 millimeter. The origin of the coordinate system for our measurements is the point where the pen touches the paper vertically when the device is aligned in the starting box position. From that point the robots moves 90.0 cm to the front or makes a curve to the left or right. We drew a 1*1 cm2 width check-board, starting at 80 cm from y axis, to facilitate the measuring process.\\

For the forward move the true value is (0, 90) and the following accuracy and precision are derived: (See calculations.ods)
\begin{itemize}
\item	Accuracy over x axis  = 0.1
\item	Accuracy over y axis  = 0.0

\item	Precision over x axis = 1.0
\item	Precision over y axis = 0.0
\end{itemize}


For the left turn the true values are calculated as (-10.266, 89.206) and the following accuracy and precision are derived:

\begin{itemize}	
\item	Accuracy over x axis  = -2.5
\item	Accuracy over y axis  = -0.4

\item	Precision over x axis = 0.6
\item	Precision over y axis = 0.2
\end{itemize}


For the right turn the true values are calculated as (10.266, 89.206) and the following accuracy and precision are derived:

\begin{itemize}	
\item	Accuracy over x axis  = 1.3
\item	Accuracy over y axis  = -0.4

\item	Precision over x axis = 1.3
\item	Precision over y axis = 0.0
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
The process of finding these numbers and also random errors over x and y axises are also included in the attached tables. 
From the numbers it can be seen that the there's a high systematic error over x axis specially for the left turn. Meanwhile it can be also observed that the precision over x axis is also higher. 
It can be also observed that in each of the 3 runs of the experiment (forward, left and right) , the point clouds were almost accumulated as 2 separate bunch of points next to each other. This may be due to a systematic error within the two motors.

\subsection{Possible sources of error}

\begin{itemize}
\item The coordinate system and the measurement instrument had millimeter sensitivity however in some cases the true measurement of the point required less than millimeter sensitivity. In these cases we used the closest observed measure for that point ( For example: (2.1, 88.9) instead of (2.17, 88.86)) 
\item Placing the robot manually at the starting position at each iteration , imposes some error to the overall result.
\item Differential drive can by itself have small errors in wheel rotation measurements. When these small errors are accumulated, they can cause small drifting and the robot may end up in slightly different positions. 
\item The number of runs for each direction seems to be insufficient and this has made the interpretations harder. 
\item Some outliers may be due to failure in parts of the robot like wheels, for instance we saw an outlier in left turn because the right wheel came off its axis.  
\item Even though we tried to stick the papers such that they have no gaps and no overlays to minimize the errors, there might be still a small error imposed because of this intersection and the fact that paper is not totally flat.
\item The wheels may also slip on the surface and this can make bigger errors.
\end{itemize}
